# Skill workshop

Passive after-turn capture of reusable workflows (#3328). Detects when a
user is teaching the agent a rule (`from now on always run cargo fmt`,
`no, do it like X`, repeated tool sequences) and stores draft candidate
skills under `~/.librefang/skills/pending/` for human review. Approved
candidates are promoted into the active skill registry through the same
`evolution::create_skill` path that gates marketplace skills, so every
artefact visible to the agent's prompt has crossed the same security
boundary.

The whole subsystem is **on by default with the conservative knob set**:
heuristic-only review (no LLM call), pending policy (every candidate
waits for human approve / reject), 20-candidate cap. An agent that
omits the `[skill_workshop]` block in `agent.toml` gets exactly that.
Operators that want LLM refinement set
`[skill_workshop] review_mode = "threshold_llm"`; operators that want
to disable the feature set `enabled = false`.

The cost regression vs pre-#3328 is bounded: per turn, three regex
scanners on the most recent message and a small toml file when a
candidate lands. No LLM call unless the operator opts in.

```

The detached task is supervised — `tokio::spawn` is wrapped by the same
`supervised_spawn` helper that auto_dream uses, so a panic inside any
stage logs `error!` and unwinds without taking down the agent loop.

## Per-agent configuration

Agents that omit the `[skill_workshop]` block in `agent.toml` get the
defaults shown below — heuristic-only capture into pending/. Override
any subset; serde fills the rest from `Default`.

```toml
# agent.toml — explicit form, equivalent to omitting the block:
[skill_workshop]
enabled         = true             # default true
auto_capture    = true             # default true
approval_policy = "pending"        # "pending" | "auto"
review_mode     = "heuristic"      # "heuristic" | "threshold_llm" | "both"
max_pending     = 20               # 0 disables writes (pipeline still runs)

# To turn the feature off entirely:
# enabled = false

# To get LLM refinement (cheap-tier provider chain):
# review_mode = "threshold_llm"
```

| Field | Default | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch. With `false`, the hook returns before scanners run. |
| `auto_capture` | `true` | Lets an enabled agent skip capture without disabling the whole hook (useful for live debugging of an agent that you don't want to disturb). |
| `approval_policy` | `"pending"` | `"pending"` parks candidates in `~/.librefang/skills/pending/<agent>/`. `"auto"` immediately promotes through `evolution::create_skill`, with the same security scan applied. |
| `review_mode` | `"heuristic"` | `"heuristic"` is regex-only (no LLM cost). `"threshold_llm"` ALSO consults the cheap-tier LLM after the heuristic accepts; `"both"` runs LLM review even when heuristics say drop. |
| `max_pending` | `20` | Per-agent cap. `0` is honoured as "do not store" — the pipeline still runs but `save_candidate` returns `Ok(false)`. |

The hook re-reads the config from `AgentRegistry` on every fire, so
`agent.toml` edits take effect on the next turn without daemon restart.
This differs from `max_concurrent_invocations`, which is captured at
agent bind time and requires kill-and-respawn (CLAUDE.md convention).

## Storage layout

```
~/.librefang/skills/
  pending/
    <agent_uuid>/
      <candidate_uuid>.toml          ← single CandidateSkill, TOML
      <candidate_uuid>.toml.tmp      ← only present mid-write; pruned at boot
  <skill_name>/                       ← active skills (output of approve)
    skill.toml
    prompt_context.md
    versions/
```

`<agent_uuid>` is the agent's UUID; storage entry points (`save`,
`list`, `load`, `reject`, `approve`) all reject anything that does not
parse as a UUID, collapsing every traversal vector (`..`, `..\\`,
homoglyphs, …) into one positive check. `<candidate_uuid>` is generated
by the hook at capture time.

`list_pending_all` (used by the dashboard) defensively skips child dirs
whose name is not UUID-shaped. A stray `pending/__planted__/` cannot
pollute the listing.

### Concurrency

Single-writer-per-agent is **assumed but not enforced**. The hook fires
at most once per turn per agent; the only path to concurrent writes is
the same agent running multiple parallel turns
(`max_concurrent_invocations > 1` plus `session_mode = "new"`), in
which case the cap check between two saves can transiently observe a
stale directory listing and write one extra candidate before evicting.
The breach is bounded by the in-flight invocation count and self-heals
on the next save. If parallel-invocation usage grows, the upgrade path
is per-agent `fs2::FileExt::lock_exclusive`, mirroring
`librefang_skills::evolution::acquire_skill_lock`.

## Security model

Defense in depth. A candidate body crosses the same prompt-injection
scanner twice and at least one human gate before the agent ever sees
it as a prompt artefact.

| Stage | Surface | Scanner | Behaviour on Critical |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------------------|
| Capture | `save_candidate` | `SkillVerifier::scan_prompt_content` over `prompt_context`, `description`, and both provenance excerpts | Abort with `SecurityBlocked`; nothing reaches disk |
| Promotion | `approve_candidate` → `evolution::create_skill` | Same scanner over `prompt_context` again | Abort; pending file kept so reviewer can edit |
| LLM-refined fields | `apply_refinements` (mod.rs) | Charset + length filter, `[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}` for name, ≤200 chars description | Refinement dropped; heuristic-suggested values kept |

The LLM reviewer is treated as **untrusted output**. The candidate body
shipped to the model is partly user-influenced text, so the model's own
reply could contain attacker-shaped JSON fragments. `strip_json_envelope`
takes leftmost `{` to rightmost `}` — when multiple JSON blocks appear
the slice is malformed, `serde_json::from_str` fails, and the verdict
falls to `Indeterminate`, which routes through the same heuristic
verdict the LLM was reviewing. There is no path from "model output"
to "candidate accepted" that bypasses the heuristic gate.

Excerpt bounds (`PROVENANCE_EXCERPT_MAX_CHARS = 800`) are enforced in
characters, not bytes, so multibyte truncation never panics on UTF-8
boundaries.

## Cost model

Three cases, increasing in cost:

**Default config (`enabled=true`, `review_mode="heuristic"`)**

Per turn:
1. Hook gating (`AgentLoopEnd` event compare, `is_fork` flag check, kernel `Weak::upgrade`).
2. `agent_registry().get(agent_id)` — dashmap O(1) + clone of `AgentEntry`.
3. Three regex scanners run over the latest user message + last assistant turn — microsecond-scale.
4. On a hit (rare), one `SkillVerifier::scan_prompt_content` pass over the candidate body / description / provenance excerpts (regex over a few KB of text), then a TOML serialise + atomic file write of a few KB.

No SQLite, no LLM. A turn that does not produce a hit pays only the regex scan; a turn that hits pays the security scan + a small file write.

**LLM-augmented (`review_mode="threshold_llm"` or `"both"`)**

Same as above, plus on each heuristic hit a single auxiliary LLM call (cheap-tier chain: haiku → gpt-4o-mini → openrouter-haiku). With `threshold_llm` the call only runs when heuristics already accepted; with `both` it runs even when heuristics rejected. If no cheap-tier provider is configured, the workshop returns `Indeterminate` rather than billing the call to the operator's primary provider — see [`AuxTask` routing](#auxiliary-llm-routing-auxtaskskillworkshopreview).

**Disabled (`enabled=false`)**

Hook gating runs (steps 1–2 above), then short-circuits on `!cfg.enabled`. No regex scan, no FS, no LLM. The dashmap clone in step 2 is the only non-trivial cost; if it ever shows up in a flame graph, the fix is to peek at `entry().map(|e| e.manifest.skill_workshop.enabled)` without cloning the manifest. Currently below the noise floor.

At kernel boot, `prune_orphan_temp_files` runs in `Handle::spawn_blocking` when a tokio runtime is current, with a sync fallback for `set_self_handle` callers that lack one. Boot does not block on a `read_dir` walk of the pending tree.

## Auxiliary LLM routing (`AuxTask::SkillWorkshopReview`)

Skill review is a **separate** `AuxTask` slot from
`AuxTask::SkillReview` (which is owned by
`kernel::messaging::background_skill_review`). They share the same
default cheap-tier chain in `aux_client::default_chain` —
`haiku → gpt-4o-mini → openrouter-haiku` — but configuration changes
to one do not silently affect the other.

`AuxClient::resolve` returns `used_primary = true` when no cheap-tier
credentials are configured. The workshop respects this signal and
returns `ReviewDecision::Indeterminate` rather than billing review
calls to the user's primary (paid) provider. A passive subsystem
turning on premium calls would be a financial DoS; the check is a
hard gate, not a soft preference.

## CLI

```
librefang skill pending list [--agent <uuid>]
librefang skill pending show <candidate_uuid>
librefang skill pending approve <candidate_uuid>
librefang skill pending reject <candidate_uuid>
```

Approval is the only path that promotes a candidate. There is no
"shadow" promotion that bypasses the second security scan — the API
route shares the same `storage::approve_candidate` entry point.

## HTTP

| Method | Path | Returns |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/skills/pending` | List for all agents (`?agent=<uuid>` filters) |
| `GET` | `/api/skills/pending/{id}` | Single candidate |
| `POST` | `/api/skills/pending/{id}/approve` | Promote, return new skill name + version |
| `POST` | `/api/skills/pending/{id}/reject` | Drop without promoting |

All four routes are authenticated (no entry in the `is_public`
allowlist). `WorkshopError::InvalidId` round-trips as 400; not-found
as 404; security-block / promotion conflicts as 409.
